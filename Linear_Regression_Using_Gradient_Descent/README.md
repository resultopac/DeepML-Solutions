# Linear Regression Using Gradient Descent

**Difficulty**: Medium | **Category**: Machine Learning

## Description

Write a Python function that performs linear regression using gradient descent. The function should take NumPy arrays X (features with a column of ones for the intercept) and y (target) as input, along with the learning rate alpha and the number of iterations. Return the learned coefficients (weights) as a NumPy array.

(x)=Xθ is the prediction and 
𝑚
m is the number of samples. The factor of 1/2 simplifies the gradient calculation.

Initialize all weights to zero

Use batch gradient descent (use all samples in each iteration)

The input matrix X has shape (m, n) where m is the number of training examples and n is the number of features (including the bias column of ones). The target vector y has shape (m,).

### Example:

- **Input:** X = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3]]), y = np.array([3, 5, 7]), alpha = 0.1, iterations = 1000

- **Output:** [1.0, 2.0]

- **Reasoning:** The data follows y = 1 + 2x perfectly. Starting from theta = [0, 0], gradient descent iteratively updates the weights until converging to approximately [1, 2], representing an intercept of 1 and slope of 2.
